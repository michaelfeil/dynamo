# `--grpc-protocol openengine` needs the OpenEngine bindings, which resolve only
# from a custom index. Both packages are pinned to BSR module commit
# 768a93c7b44e, the same revision the vendored protos in `proto/` were generated
# from (see `proto/README.md`), so the engine and the sidecar speak the same
# contract revision.
#
# The protobuf package is pinned by *gencode* version as well: buf publishes one
# build per protoc release, and a gencode newer than the runtime in the
# TensorRT-LLM image fails at import with "Detected incompatible Protobuf
# Gencode/Runtime versions". 33.5 matches the protobuf 6.33.x runtime those
# images ship. Raise it only together with the image's protobuf.

# PyPI, so pinning it exactly closes that. TensorRT-LLM's
