"""Verify that a pull request references at least one existing issue.

Accepted references, matching how the Linear GitHub integration links work:

- A Linear issue ID (for example ``DYN-1234``) in the PR title or description,
  optionally behind a magic word (``Closes DYN-1234``), or embedded in the
  branch name (``user/dyn-1234-short-description``).
- A GitHub issue reference in the PR title or description: ``#123``, a
  closing keyword form (``Fixes #123``), an org-scoped cross-repo reference
  (``ai-dynamo/enhancements#12`` - contribution requests and the older DEPs
  live in sibling repositories), or a full issue URL.

A Dynamo Enhancement Proposal does not satisfy the check on its own. A DEP is
a proposal umbrella that stays open across many pull requests, so it says what
the work is part of and not what any one change is. Keep the ``Part of <dep>``
reference and link the work issue as well.

Every candidate is verified against the corresponding API; a reference to an
issue that does not exist does not count. Verification failures caused by API
outages are treated as unverified-but-present so that an upstream outage never
fails anyone's PR (fail open).
